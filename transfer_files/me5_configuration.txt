#! Pythia8 path.
#!  Defines the path to the pythia8 directory.
#!  This is the directory that contains the subdirectory examples;

#! Herwig++ paths
#!  specify here the paths also to HepMC ant ThePEG
#!  define the path to the herwig++, thepeg and hepmc directories.
#!  paths can be absolute or relative from mg5 directory
